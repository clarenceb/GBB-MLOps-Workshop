The Azure Machine Learning python SDK's [PyTorch estimator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-train-pytorch) enables you to easily submit PyTorch training jobs for both single-node and distributed runs on Azure compute. The model is trained to classify dog breeds first using a pretrained ResNet152 model that has been trained on the [Stanford Dog dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/). This dataset has been built using images and annotation from ImageNet for the task of fine-grained image categorization. For time, we will use a subset of this dataset which includes 40 dog breeds."

    "## What is Azure Machine Learning service?\n",
    "Azure Machine Learning service (Preview) is a cloud service that you can use to develop and deploy machine learning models. Using Azure Machine Learning service, you can track your models as you build, train, deploy, and manage them, all at the broad scale that the cloud provides.\n",

    "## How can we use it for training image classification models?\n",
    "Training machine learning models, particularly deep neural networks, is often a time- and compute-intensive task. Once you've finished writing your training script and running on a small subset of data on your local machine, you will likely want to scale up your workload.\n",
    "\n",
    "To facilitate training, the Azure Machine Learning Python SDK provides a high-level abstraction, the estimator class, which allows users to easily train their models in the Azure ecosystem. You can create and use an Estimator object to submit any training code you want to run on remote compute, whether it's a single-node run or distributed training across a GPU cluster. For PyTorch and TensorFlow jobs, Azure Machine Learning also provides respective custom PyTorch and TensorFlow estimators to simplify using these frameworks.\n",
