# Welcome to Pycon Canada!

In this tutorial, you will learn how to train your own image classification model using transfer learning. The Azure Machine Learning python SDK's [PyTorch estimator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/service/how-to-train-pytorch) enables you to easily submit PyTorch training jobs for both single-node and distributed runs on Azure compute. The model is trained to classify dog breeds using a pretrained ResNet18 model that has been trained on the [Stanford Dog dataset](http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/). This dataset has been built using images and annotation from ImageNet for the task of fine-grained image categorization. For time, we will use a subset of this dataset which includes 40 dog breeds.

You can view the subset of the data used [here](https://github.com/heatherbshapiro/pycon-canada/tree/master/breeds-10). 

Please refer to the dog-breed-classifier.ipynb notebook for instructions.
